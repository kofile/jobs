We're looking for experienced front-end engineers to help develop our cloud service for local governments. 

This is a remote position. US only.

We're looking for people with:

* Deep experience creating responsive HTML/CSS layouts. 
* Experience building robust React-based front-ends with Redux and/or hooks. 
* Experience creating accessible markup and Javascript

Bonus points for:

* Experience interacting with RESTful APIs and/or websockets APIs
* Experience with Node.js back-end code.

Our application is a search portal for public records, built on modern dev stack
with modern dev practices. Most government web sites are terrible - come help us build 
one that doesn't suck.
